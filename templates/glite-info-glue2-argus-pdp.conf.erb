# This is the configuration file for the GlueService information provider
# for the ARGUS PDP service

# Extended with GLUE 2 attributes

# Many of the entries are commands which will be executed
# using backquotes in perl. They should write to stdout - the return
# code is not relevant except for init and status.

# The init command allows any setup command to be executed
# A non-zero return code will abort the provider
# Environment variables can be set by writing to stdout (x=y)

# in the format 3[.2[.1]] - for Argus just set this to 1.0.0 for now

# in the init script)

#get_endpoint = echo https://$ARGUS_HOST:$ARGUS_PDP_PORT/authz

# A command to check the status of the service. The status message should be
# returned to stdout - it can be multi-line, the output will be massaged
# and truncated if necessary. 
# The return code should indicate the status:
# 0 = OK, 1 = Critical, 2 = Warning, 3 = Unknown, other = Other

# If the string does not start with "http" this will be omitted
